# registers-1bit-16bit-16bitpc-16to3bitnzp
This contains VHDL description for a 1 bit register, a 16 bit register, a 16 bit Program Counter (PC) and a 16 bit to 3 bit NZP logic register. Testbenches are generated for each register as well as input and output test vectors generated with MATLAB. I also added the .do files for the simulations of each register.
